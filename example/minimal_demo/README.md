# Simplest example of NSFWJS possible

Please do not use this code in your app.  It depends on our S3.  You can download the needed files and set this up yourself so that you host them on your site, but for simplicity's sake, I wanted to make a very simple and basic version to demo.

Simply double click `index.html` and view your console log for a result.
